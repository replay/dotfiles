Finally, a month ago, I discovered the true fount of insight into the
nature of the beast. A book is available, to those who know who and what
to ask for. Kept in the deepest dungeon of a library's stacks, its cover
sealed with bronze clasps and its spine earthed by a silver chain, the
book of the camel contains all the forbidden knowledge any evil
necromancer could desire. There, laid out for my delectation was all the
truth that my bleeding forehead could contain. Bleeding, for upon
reading the book I was driven to pound my head upon the stone
cobblestones of the oubliette to which the librarian had driven me. For
I now realize that I have no hope of salvation; that my soul is
eternally doomed to torment, and that the evil that gibbers and howls in
the void beyond space will have me in the end. For I discovered secret
clauses buried in the text of the book; and there was much howling and
grinding of teeth as I realised what my earlier incantations had
achieved. The camel has a mind of its own, a subtle and demented
psychosis as old as time and twice as huge: it is eating my brain with a
tea-spoon, and I feel quite sick. I have become the vector for a plague
out of space-time, a language with embedded magic and probabilistic
parsers, a language that is eating my soul! Even the scholars of the
local university would be hard-pressed to conduct a successful exorcism.
For I have been polluted; the nemesis of orthogonality, the beast of
UNIX, has laid its claws in my heart.

I cannot control myself any more. Soon I shall be entirely its creature,
and then I shall be forced to write down the forbidden knowledge I have
received -- to write it down and publish it in an innocucous-looking
volume, presented to the general reader so they might suffer and wilt in
its hideous grasp.

But first I warn you! Flee while you can! Flee before the approach of
the dread beast with one hump and no 'a' in its name, flee before it
eats your mind as it has

Oh, that's better. I feel all right now. Don't worry, everything is
under control.

There is no cause for alarm.

I repeat: there is no cause for alarm.
